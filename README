Puppet Sudoers Module
=====================

Manage sudo entries in appropriate sudoers file

I am tired of managing my sudoers content via the file type and figure it would be nice to do things such as:

sudo { carla:
  ensure => present,
  nopasswd => true,
  commands => "ALL",
}

and for a group, we can set isgroup => true

In order to ensure os-specific resources are satifisied, the following definitions have been provided:

sudo::user
sudo::group

Each definition makes use of the sudoers type with sudo::group making use of the isgroup parameter.
